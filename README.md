 # Interview Repository

Hello, I'm [Vin√≠cius Roratto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viniciusroratto/) and this repo was created to help the interviewers to understand a bit more about my coding skills. I hope it helps!

This repo is divided in five folders, each showing code excerpts of projects that I think can

## Python
This is my go-to language because of its community. It's very difficult to find a problem that nobody has faced and solved somehow.
The only file in the folder is a class I've adapted from a work I did for a small accountancy firm in Malta. They needed multiple data extractions from different websites, and then some table merges and simple cleaning and manipulation.

  The class shown here receives the URL for the manipulation, starts the selenium driver (giving the developer some options) and extracts the rows of the table in the website, storing a dataframe in memory and a CSV file in disk. Honestly, most of this project has been done using Functional Programming, because I have worked mostly alone and code maintenance is not a problem I usually have. This is one of the reasons I want to work for bigger companies and bigger data engineering projects.


## Data-Cleaning and Manipulation
  Since my previous experience was closer to data analysis, I've taken some courses about data cleaning and manipulation. This folder has the code for the final coursework of the Data Cleaning and Manipulation course in Coursera, it's basically downloading a file and cleaning it based on a set of specifications. It was fun to learn the basics of R,  and every skill I've acquired from the course was then transposed to Python.

## SQL
  I have three files for SQL
  The first one is, for me, the biggest challenge: turning clients' needs into real specification. The image **T1-FBD.png** is a simple UDM (universal data model) I've used in a course last year. I've heard someone talking about the needs of their company, and translated it into the model.
 
  The second example is one exercise. The file **Join_query_exercises.sql** was created to test if I could do some complex queries and joins.
 
  The third one **(Main.java)** is a simple implementation of a Java application that connects to a database, and makes some queries.

## Terraform/GCP
  Honestly, I have no previous experience in the GCP, so I spent most of this weekend clicking around and watching videos and following tutorials. But point and click interfaces are hardly very scalable and give us no space to use software engineering concepts to improve infrastructure. So I went after Terraform, a tool to implement infrastructure as code and followed some GCP tutorials in it. I had used Terraform just a few weeks ago to create some internet usage monitors for a provider called Datadog.
 
   You can see the basic implementation in the **main.tf** file, and the results in the images I've uploaded. I'm sorry if some of the text is in Portuguese, I'll be happy to translate it to you during the interview! :)
